# Project-01

## Description of Site
"Sip First" is an app for an individual that lives in SF and is looking to grab a drink. The premise of this site was to address paralysis by analysis which occurs when users are overwhelmed with too many choices and often do not feel satisfaction even after making a choice due to wondering, 'what if'.

This site will simplify the decision making process for individuals by displaying two options (prioritized by rating) from the Yelp API for the user to choose from.
